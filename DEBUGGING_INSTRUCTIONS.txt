=== FINAL DEBUGGING TEST FOR LOGGED-IN USER RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to Console tab
3. If not logged in, click 'Login' and use test credentials
4. Navigate to any product page (e.g., click on a shoe)
5. Look for the 'Recommendations' section on the product page
6. Check the Console for debug logs showing:
   - User ID being passed to API
   - API response data
   - Any error messages
7. If recommendations still don't show, check Network tab for:
   - /api/recommendations/enhanced requests
   - Response status and data

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Logged-in users should see recommendations
- If API errors occur, default recommendations should display
- Console should show detailed debug information

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
- Added MongoDB casting error handling
- Added user ID validation
- Added fallback to default recommendations
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Fixed error handling in all recommendation methods

NOTE: The backend may show MongoDB casting errors in the terminal, but the API should now handle these gracefully and return default recommendations instead of failing.
